# Flappy-Nyan-proj

This is a replication of the famous game Flappy Bird made by three fellows from the coding course of the POLIMI TechCamp 2021.
All is made thanks the pygame library that makes us able to modify the graphics and the user interaction with the software. In the Tech_Project are folded all the main project's 
file (including the main python file).

Have a nice day of coding,
kawika.
